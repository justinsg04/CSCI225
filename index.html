            <p>Hello, my name is Justin. I attend USC Aiken and I'm a junior. My major is 
                Computer Science with no current concentration. My favorite place to go is the beach. This summer I interned at SRNS
                as a Web Designer, so I am familiar with HTML coding. I am excited to learn more in this class!
            </p>

                <li>Barcode Scanner System - My first ever project/internship was at Bridgestone. I was assigned to make a scanner system that allowed someone to scan a Barcode
                   and input the information linked to the barcode in Microsoft SQL database. I did this using .NET framework. It was my first time using databases so I struggled quite a bit.

                <li>
                    Airplane Travel System - One of the biggest projects during my degree was the Airplane Planner System. I did this when I was in the Software Engineering class. My group and
                    I used java in VS Code. We also used GitHub to share our individual progess with the project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Department SharePoint - My latest completed project would be the a SharePoint that I created during my internship at SRNS. This was probably the easiest project so far,
                    it mainly involved laying out and desinging information, which I found to be simple. I used the Adobe suite to design graphics.
