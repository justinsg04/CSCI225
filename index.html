            Hello, my name is Justin. I attend USC Aiken and I'm a junior. My major is 
            Computer Science with no current concentration. My favorite place to go is the beach. This summer I interned at SRNS
            as a Web Designer, so I am familiar with HTML coding. I am excited to learn more in this class! <br>
            As the semester reaches the midpoint, I have learned a lot more about HTML and CSS. I enjoy learning more about these topics because I work with
            HTML every day.

        <ol>
            <li>Barcode Scanner System - My first ever project/internship was at Bridgestone. I was assigned to make a scanner system that allowed someone to scan a Barcode
               and input the information linked to the barcode in Microsoft SQL database. I did this using .NET framework. It was my first time using databases so I struggled quite a bit.
            </li>
            <li>Airplane Travel System - One of the biggest projects during my degree was the Airplane Planner System. I did this when I was in the Software Engineering class. My group and
                I used Java in VS Code. We also used GitHub to share our individual progress with the project.
            </li>
            <li>Department SharePoint - My latest completed project would be the SharePoint that I created during my internship at SRNS. This was probably the easiest project so far,
                it mainly involved laying out and designing information, which I found to be simple. I used the Adobe suite to design graphics.
            </li>
        </ol>
